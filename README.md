## Technologies used to create site
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Firebase API for database hosting</li>

## How to use the Firebase API
<p>To learn about the Firebase API and how to add Firebase to your web app, read the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup" target="_blank">Firebase documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Because Firebase is a Google product, you will need to use your Google account to access and log into Firebase. If you don't have a Google account, you will need to create one.</p>


## How to use the schedule builder site

### Field and button definitions

### Adding a train to the schedule

### Removing a train from the schedule

### Updating the train schedule

## Future feature enhancements
<ul>
	<li>Add online help page.</li>
	<li>Make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use the site. Read up on Firebase authentication for this.</li>
	<li>Try adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements -- allow them to change a train's name, destination, and arrival time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).</li>
	<li>Consider updating "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).</li>
</ul>
